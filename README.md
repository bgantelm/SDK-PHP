Recast.AI official SDK in PHP

## Synospis

This module is a PHP interface to the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API. It allows you to make request to your bots

## Installation

composer require recastai/sdk-php
```

## Usage

```

## Specs

### Classes

This module contains 4 classes, as follows:

* Client is the client allowing you to make requests.
* Response contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).
* Entity represents an entity found by Recast.AI in your user's input.
* RecastError is the error returned by the module.

Don't hesitate to dive into the code, it's commented ;)

## class Client

The Client can be instanciated with a token and a language (both optional).

```php
$client = new Client(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_LANGUAGE);
```

__Your tokens:__

[token]: https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-NodeJs/blob/master/misc/recast-ai-tokens.png "Tokens"

![alt text][token]

*Copy paste your request access token from your bot's settings.*

__Your language__

```php
$client = new Client(YOUR_TOKEN, 'en');
```
*The language is a lowercase 639-1 isocode.*

## Text Request

textRequest(text, options = { token: YOUR_TOKEN, language: YOUR_LANGUAGE, proxy: YOUR_URL_PROXY })

If your pass a token or a language in the options parameter, it will override your default client language or token.
You can pass a proxy url in the options if needed.

```php
$res = $client->textRequest(YOUR_TEXT);
// Do your code...Â¯

})
```

```php
// With optional parameters

$options = array('language' => 'YOUR_LANGUAGE', 'token' => 'YOUR_TOKEN');

$res = $client->textRequest(YOUR_TEXT, $options);  

// Do your code...

```

__If a language is provided:__ the language you've given is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used.

__If no language is provided:__ the language of the text is detected and is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used for processing.

## File Request

fileRequest(file, callback, options = { token: YOUR_TOKEN, language: YOUR_LANGUAGE, proxy: YOUR_PROXY_URL })

If your pass a token or a language in the options parameter, it will override your default client language or token.
You can pass a proxy url in the options if needed.

__file format: .wav__

```php
$res = $client->fileRequest('myFile.wav');

// Do your code...

})
```

```php
$options = array('language' => 'en', 'token' => YOUR_TOKEN);

$res = $client->fileRequest('myFile.wav', $options);
  // Do your code...

```

__If a language is provided:__
Your bot's primary language is used for processing as we do not provide language detection for speech.

__If no language is provided:__
The language you've given is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used
